ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! ä½ å¥½!

I'm an honours student in applied computational mathematics & machine learning at the University of Sydney. 

Here you will find a list of projects that I have completed in my spare time out of pure interest and curiosity. 

Outside of maths and programming I enjoy hiking, go (å›´æ£‹), and over-analysing movies.
